# Pendulum-Simulations
This simulations shows off regular and double pendulums. Taking inspiration from Think Twice's video, "Double pendulum | Chaos | Butterfly effect | Computer simulation", this processing program simulates and visualizes single and double pendulums as well as the multiple pendulums present in Think Twice's video.
<br/>
<br/>
One shows off chaos theory and how it pertains to double pendulums, showing how double pendulums are sensitive to initial conditions such as their starting angles.
<br/>
<br/>
One shows and compares the motion and trajectory laid out by a single and double pendulum.
<br/>
<br/>
One shows off the ending animation of Think Twice's video with only the endpoints of the multiple double pendulums present.
